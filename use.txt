 
This tool is a combined and compressed tool based on base62 encoding.

  Provide two startup files:
     > merge.bat                Merge all the js files in this directory and output the output_merger.js files.
     > compression.bat		Combine and compress all the js files in this directory, and output the output_compression.js file.

Or you can use the command line for encryption, but you must first use uglifyjs for obfuscation and compression.
  Example:
     >uglifyjs ol-debu.js ol.mapsuite.js -o output.js
     >base62 output.js -m output_merge.js             Merge the js files in this directory and output the output.js files.
     >base62 output.js -c output_compression.js       Combine and compress the js files in this directory, and output the output.js file.


Thank you for using it. If you have any questions, please contact me.
